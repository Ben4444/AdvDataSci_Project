# AdvDataSci_Project
Final Project for Advanced Data Science I

All data sourced from Dropbox.

Reproducibility in actually running code begins from sampled tweets in .csv format (all_locations.csv). 
However, the original full JSON file (twitter_data.json), and unprocessed JSON sample (tweets.json; also saved as R objects tweets_flat.rmd and tweets_tbl.rmd), 
are loaded in my Dropbox and code is provided to load and work with those datasets if one wants to conduct the full analysis from the very beginning.
